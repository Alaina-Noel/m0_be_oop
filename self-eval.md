# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
***It feels good!***

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
***My workflow is going well but this week I've been pretty sick and so I don't know if I have
an accurate read on my workflow yet.***

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
***I think I need a secondary space to sit and work. I have one space that's comfortable but I am working on created a low
desk behind me that I can move to when I need a change of scenery. I could only use that space if I don't need the
big monitor.***
